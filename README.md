# Generate-TV-scripts-
## Project Overview
This repository hosts code used in third project on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree.

The aim is to generate Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs using Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network built generates a new, "fake" TV script.
## Getting started
Open the tv_script_generation.ipynb on a GPU enabled Python notebook environment, or Google colab (a link is directly on top in the notebook file). The notebook consists of further technical details. Run the notebook to generate your own unique script.
